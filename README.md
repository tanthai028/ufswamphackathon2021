Hello! This is RetroFi!

# Our Idea
We were motivated by Swamphack's retro and finance themed challenges. Coupled with being broke college kids that lacked much financial understanding, we were inspired to combine these various aspects. We realised that our former education did not teach us how to do necessary tasks like budgeting, paying taxes and investing, so we sought to make a web application that would do just that. This was how RetroFi came to be.

# What it does
Our project has different aspects

A budgeting tool that helps students visualise and break down their monthly finances into different categories.
An investment tool that helps students calculate interest rates for investments but also doubles as a student loan interest calculator.
Tutorials and different modules that walks through the necessities of how to open bank accounts, pay credit and debit cards, do taxes and more.
An engaging, educational text-based game (gotta love the retro theme) that teaches how to spend wisely.
How we built it
Our web application is built with Javascript using the React framework to implement the frontend. In addition, we utilised other resources like Materials-UI, graph API, routers and more to develop the visuals on the site. To compliment the features and tools of our application, we created retro-themed graphics and backgrounds on Photoshop.

# To run it:

(we messed up the directories and accidentally created a nested directory)
4. npm install
5. npm start
